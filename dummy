Candidate Technical Evaluation Feedback

The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of problem-solving at an easy to medium level. She was able to think through the solutions effectively and confidently tackled problems she had practiced before. However, when the complexity of the problem was increased or when variations were introduced, she found it challenging to adapt and arrive at a solution efficiently. This indicates that while she has practiced problem-solving, she may need to work on improving her ability to handle unfamiliar or advanced problem variations.

On the backend side, she has a good grasp of Java, Spring, and Spring Boot, showing familiarity with core concepts and practical implementations. She has an intermediate level of understanding of Java multi-threading but may benefit from deepening her knowledge in this area. When it came to design-level questions, she faced some difficulties, suggesting that she may need to strengthen her understanding of system design and architecture principles.

Overall, the candidate was able to handle easy and medium-level questions well but may benefit from improving her ability to think through more complex problem variations, enhancing her system design skills, and further strengthening her knowledge of multi-threading.
